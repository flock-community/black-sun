# @flock/black-sun

Black sun is the Design System of Flock. It's name has been derived from the flocking behaviour of birds occurring in the marshlands in Denmark. The Danish call it "sort sol", because the amount of birds are so much that they obliterate the sunset. [Read more on Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_sol_(bird_flock)>).

It exposes the color set defined in the Flock style guide.
